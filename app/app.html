        <p class="Introduction">
            This website is designed to showcase some of common sorting algorithms that 
            present themselves to most Computer Science majors as they traverse the college experience.
            It is known that many people achieve understanding through seeing a visual of what they want, so this website
            aims to tackle that by presenting the algorithms in the form of sorted bars. 
            
            Please enjoy your stay.
